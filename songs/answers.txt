1. From the average points for energy, valence, and danceability, I would categorize this listener's aura to be orange and purple.

2. There are two reasons I think this result is inaccurate:
   - the three category we are looking at only relates to certain auras, which can force the result towards those auras.
   - we don't know the number of total streams this listener have. It's possible that these songs are those 100, but the percentage of the stream numbers of these songs are relatively low.https://myaccount.nationalgrid.com/s/account-overview?billingAccountRoleId=a0u7V00000PWVYUQA5
