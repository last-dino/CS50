Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, many of the countries have a 0 percent winning chance, which is inaccurate as shown in larger number of simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations
